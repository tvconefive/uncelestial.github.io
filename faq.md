## FAQ (Fan-Asked Questions)

The best way to ask us questions: On our subreddit at [uncelestial.reddit.com](http://uncelestial.reddit.com), via Twitter [@uncelestial](https://www.twitter.com/uncelestial), or just [edit this page and add a new question](https://github.com/uncelestial/uncelestial.github.io/edit/master/faq.md). We'll try to respond ASAP and archive the answer here. 


## Why singles and not an album?

Because in order to do the open source thing as I want to do it, I want to be able to
release album-length "singles" that have all the multi-track information right alongside
the final, mixed product, so that there would be very wide participation. Because I have
so many songs to get through (a double-album's worth), it seemed more fun, and like it
would all be more successful, if I did the releases in singles so that everyone had time
to do their remixes before the next thing came out, and so that I didn't put out a
bloated, ridiculous, mega release that was a double-album plus 200 tracks of multitrack
isolations. 

Also, being only human, this allows me to stagger my work a bit and release
things as they're ready, instead of toiling on a "masterpiece" for years like I'm Kevin
Shields or something. I like the idea of there being a sort of building momentum to the
string of releases - I think I need that ramp up myself to fully "engage" in it. It gives
me a lot of chances to learn and adjust and do better next time. I think I'd crumble under
the pressure if I did the double album route and tried promoting this big epic thing, and I
also feel like that would come off as a little too self-obsessed and grandiose. It's much
more fun to tease it out bit by bit - I hope by the end an interesting journey will have
taken place.
