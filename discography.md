# Discography

One long page with jQuery UI for cycling through a release's:

- Overview (Artwork, Release Date, Label, Credits, Store Link)
- Tracklist (bandcamp insert with 30-second samples)
- Review clippings
- Remixes (Pull from same .yaml that store uses)
- Lyrics

That way you can link directly to one release's subsection but still do it all in one page.

Singles list:

1. Someone To Lose You / (I Can Feel Myself) Getting Over It
2. Wherever You Are / If I Want You To
3. Pop Stars In Yr Head / Phobos
4. There Must Be Something Wrong With You / Punk
5. Tell Them / Third Strain
6. Get Beyond / Rise and Shine
7. And We Know / Don't Let Go
8. Disharmony / Glass Tin
9. Media Sift Through Heart Rises / Aricebo
10. Carousel / Come Into The Light / (If I Could Learn) To Love Myself
