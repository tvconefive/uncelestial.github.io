# Discography

One long page with jQuery UI for cycling through a release's:

- Overview (Artwork, Release Date, Label, Credits, Store Link)
- Tracklist (bandcamp insert with 30-second samples)
- Review clippings
- Remixes (Pull from same .yaml that store uses)
- Lyrics

That way you can link directly to one release's subsection but still do it all in one page.
