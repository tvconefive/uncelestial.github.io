## Early Musical Life

I was born in Austin. My parents - baby boomers, teens in the ‘60s, were still big fans of music,
would see shows all the time, and had a great record collection. From the womb, I
heard artists like Bob Marley, Elvis Costello, and Stevie Ray Vaughn play live. In our house 
growing up, the records of Bob Dylan, The Beatles, and Jimi Hendrix were played in mix tapes
and records around the house, as well as blues masters like John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and 
B.B. King.

At some point, my parents noticed that as I sat in my little car seat, with my tiny limbs and 
blonde hair, I would bang the restraining bar with my hands in time to the music they were
playing. Encouraged, I’m sure, by signs that their love of music was being passed on, they 
got me a little drum set when I was about 4 or 5 - and I loved them. Keyboard playing
started around this time, too, using a little Yamaha keyboard they had lying around,
and a little portable harmonium. I even started my record collection around this age;
even though my turntable was small and for kids, it rocked the likes of The Specials,
The Ramones, The Police, and Michael Jackson. 

I wrote a few cute little songs as a kid, but it didn’t really occur to me to play rock
until I was 12 and Nirvana came out. I was a bit young for the whole Gen X thing and never got to see Nirvana live, but the rise of what was called “alternative” music was profoundly interesting to me and 12-year-old me started taking music very seriously and identifying more as a musician. I started taking drum lessons, and started to teach myself guitar out of magazines and books that published tablature, all at the same time.

By the time I got to high school, I was in a band with three other pals and we were covering
all the grunge hits. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Breeders, and Urge Overkill stand out. I was on drums,
but I used to also hand-write the tablature for the two guitar parts and the bass, and give that
to the other guys so they could play. We had actually gotten a pretty good repertoire by the end,
when one of the guitarists moved away, ending our little tribe’s run.

The next year of high school, I started getting into more obscure music. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, there
wasn’t much of a music scene, nor was there a radio station that had its finger on the pulse of 
musical progress. It was pretty dry - especially if you were underage. So I had to start
with MTV, really. Alternative Nation, 120 Minutes, and Headbanger’s Ball all gave some pointers. Then
started the magazines. First the obvious ones like Rolling Stone and Spin. Then Alternative Press and
Flipside. Then you got down to Maximumrocknroll, Punk Planet, and hand-xeroxed zines like Catsup Plate.
At the beginning I was buying CDs at the mall. Then in the one really cool independent record store in Tulsa. Eventually I found myself doing mail order out of zines for music that just had a pretty good
review, or had a band member in it I knew of from another band, and it went on from there.
 
A great facilitator in all this was my new friendship with Brad Rose. In many ways we were a great
match. Both rock musicians, seeking music with a bit of grit and truth. Big fans of Kurt Cobain. I played
all the instruments he didn’t play, and I also had a 4-track cassette recorder so we could make (very
bad) “albums” full of whatever music we could come up with. He introduced me to the internet which
seemed the antidote to the isolation of Tulsa, particularly musically — and my research and discovery
of new music and new friendships took off in a new exciting direction. Most of all, whereas I had reacted
to the conservative, religious, sports-obsessed environment of Tulsa (in particular our high school) with
alienation, depression, and anxiety, Brad had reacted with defiance. That taught me a lot. We started
making a zine together called Bunnies (named after a Pansy Division song) and selling it on school grounds. I would have shied away from the intensely negative attention that attracted just a year 
earlier, but just then I felt I had accepted that fitting in wasn’t going to happen, so I might as well
be proud to be something else. This had helped me put Oklahoma in its place; all the confusion and
isolation was a matter of being mismatched, it wasn’t a matter of some personal deficiency. I felt free.

In other ways we were a terrible match. Both of us were full of strong musical opinions, and stubborn,
which injected a certain tension to our collaborations. Generally things went smoothest if I just learned
Brad’s songs and played whatever instruments needed playing, and did the recording, but didn’t try to
rearrange anything, or bring up any songs I had written. Such measures would be met with palpable
reluctance. The feelings of judgement and competition can be poisonous to a collaborative team, and 
begin to spill into very personal feelings. There were two results of this tension: one was that Brad and
I had an on-and-off-again friendship. Another was that I had a bit of a filter on when I did most of
my music-making, and Brad was acting as a foil.

In many ways, I needed a foil. My love of The Beatles and the more melodic side of rock would, in my early
days, combine with my feelings of isolation, and produce some quite embarrassing, quite emo, sickeningly
immature songs that simply didn’t need to be heard by the world. By being influenced by the more and more
progressive music I was being exposed to, and working in a situation where I really needed to have a cool
idea before I would get much in the way of cooperation, I learned better ways of musically expressing
those same feelings, but in more subtle and interesting ways.

## A Notice

> "At this point I have a request for our fans.  If any of you in any way hate 
> homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor
> for us -- leave us the fuck alone!  Don't come to our shows and don't buy our records."

-- Kurt Cobain, from the liner notes to the great *Incesticide*.

I couldn't put it any better myself, except to add many attributes that weren't
explicitly mentioned. Operate from a place of empathy or leave us alone. Discussions
will be moderated here with that in mind. We want our community to be safe and 
inclusive and fun for **everybody**, and the
only thing that makes that impossible is participation from people who antagonize
others, so it's not going to be tolerated here.

## Technology, obviously

If the adoption of some "Open Source"  and the use of GitHub didn't clue you
in, we are not exactly the sort of band that fetishizes analog as an ideal. "Warm"
guitar tones can be recorded digitally, emanating from a solid state amp. Altering
one's voice is a valid artistic choice -- it's just an effect. VST plugins are
fantastic tools and frankly the analog machines they replace have diminishing
returns for the huge investment that is required to use them.

One should feel no guilt augmenting what they do with technology -- in fact,
that can be a source of great creativity.
A good sounding record sounds that way because of the combination of ability, 
vision, and good taste -- none of which precludes or is dependent on adherence to
recording or production paradigms of the past. Musicians should relieve themselves
of their guilt over this. As soon as technology brought advances like overdubs,
retakes, distortion, compression, effects, and editing to the recording process,
any pretense of "authenticity" should have become highly suspect. 

Progress didn't stop in 1975. We have access to cheap but powerful digital tools 
that let us do a lot that was impossible for bands outside of the label/studio
world to do. Let people take advantage of that in peace.

## Authenticity is a concern, though

Music is a form of art. I define art as an attempt to communicate through a medium.
You could splatter paint randomly on a canvas, or improvise entirely random noise
onto a tape, but unless those splatters and noises were trying to convey something,
it wasn't art.

In order to communicate, an artist needs to use only their skills with that medium
to engender deep emotional reactions in the person who experiences their work. This
requires there to be an artist present at one end of the creation process who has
something they want their audience to feel. 

In the case of popular music, artists have not been present. Pop music productions
are high budget affairs involving large teams of people who gauge the success of 
their endeavors in sales. Now, I don't knock anyone for liking what they like,
and I have my [guilty pleasures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccenFp_3kq8) too.
So to be clear: the sad state of affairs going on in the pop world is not the 
fault of people just enjoying the music that's widely available. 

It's the people deciding what gets sold on the marketplace. We're in a world where
studios can announce their yearly lineup of movies and every single one will be 
a sequel, remake, or cash-in of an existing story/franchise. And, we're in a world
where music sales are shrinking to a fraction of what they were. But instead of
trying to shake things up by offering novel experiences, opening up new opportunities
with new modes of interacting with creative works, or supporting inventive artists
that change the game, the market makers who greenlight creative projects have
shrunk into their shells and played a diminishing game of less risk-taking, trying
to cling on to old paradigms that have been rendered obsolete. Not realizing the
chicken and egg issue -- which is that if they were to promote something novel and
interesting to audiences they aren't reaching now, it would sell -- they believe
that their lesson in all this is that they must do the opposite, which is to sell
very homogenous pop music to the people they already reach.

This is the thinking of out of touch people with no access to the marketplace that
will replace the paradigms that have been lost. 

In summary: 

- I reject the stupid pop music that people shrug off as being our only musical option
in the mainstream now. I also feel that rock has stagnated due to less risk
taking by non-creative market-makers, and because of puritan attitudes of old guard
rock musicians who fetishize an outdated aesthetic and music-making process.
Hence, my music and my process.

- I reject that the old marketplace was the ideal situation for musicians and we
should pine for it and rebuild it. I also feel there are novel approaches to sharing
your music with the world that haven't been explored, and there could be a greater gain
to be had in the cheap-to-join, interactive musical world that we live in now.
Hence, the open source music project.

## Why singles and not an album?

Because in order to do the open source thing as I want to do it, I want to be able to
release album-length "singles" that have all the multi-track information right alongside
the final, mixed product, so that there would be very wide participation. Because I have
so many songs to get through (a double-album's worth), it seemed more fun, and like it
would all be more successful, if I did the releases in singles so that everyone had time
to do their remixes before the next thing came out, and so that I didn't put out a
bloated, ridiculous, mega release that was a double-album plus 200 tracks of multitrack
isolations. 

Also, being only human, this allows me to stagger my work a bit and release
things as they're ready, instead of toiling on a "masterpiece" for years like I'm Kevin
Shields or something. I like the idea of there being a sort of building momentum to the
string of releases - I think I need that ramp up myself to fully "engage" in it. It gives
me a lot of chances to learn and adjust and do better next time. I think I'd crumble under
the pressure if I did the double album route and tried promoting this big epic thing, and I
also feel like that would come off as a little too self-obsessed and grandiose. It's much
more fun to tease it out bit by bit - I hope by the end an interesting journey will have
taken place.
