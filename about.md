## A Notice

> "At this point I have a request for our fans.  If any of you in any way hate 
> homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor
> for us -- leave us the fuck alone!  Don't come to our shows and don't buy our records."

-- Kurt Cobain, from the liner notes to the great *Incesticide*.

I couldn't put it any better myself, except to add many attributes that weren't
explicitly mentioned. Operate from a place of empathy or leave us alone. Discussions
will be moderated here with that in mind. We want our community to be safe and 
inclusive and fun for **everybody**, and the
only thing that makes that impossible is participation from people who antagonize
others, so it's not going to be tolerated here.

## Technology, obviously

If the adoption of some "Open Source"  and the use of GitHub didn't clue you
in, we are not exactly the sort of band that fetishizes analog as an ideal. "Warm"
guitar tones can be recorded digitally, emanating from a solid state amp. Altering
one's voice is a valid artistic choice -- it's just an effect.

One should feel no guilt augmenting what they do with technology -- in fact,
that can be a source of great creativity.
A good sounding record sounds that way because of the combination of ability, 
vision, and good taste -- none of which precludes or is dependent on adherence to
recording or production paradigms of the past. Musicians should relieve themselves
of their guilt over this. As soon as technology brought advances like overdubs,
retakes, distortion, compression, effects, and editing to the recording process,
any pretense of "authenticity" should have become highly suspect. 

Progress didn't stop in 1975. We have access to cheap but powerful digital tools 
that let us do a lot that was impossible for bands outside of the label/studio
world to do. Let people take advantage of that in peace.

## Authenticity is a concern, though

Music is a form of art. I define art as an attempt to communicate through a medium.
You could splatter paint randomly on a canvas, or improvise entirely random noise
onto a tape, but unless those splatters and noises were trying to convey something,
it wasn't art.

In order to communicate, an artist needs to use only their skills with that medium
to engender deep emotional reactions in the person who experiences their work. This
requires there to be an artist present at one end of the creation process who has
something they want their audience to feel. 

In the case of popular music, artists have not been present. Pop music productions
are high budget affairs involving large teams of people who gauge the success of 
their endeavors in sales. Now, I don't knock anyone for liking what they like,
and I have my [guilty pleasures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccenFp_3kq8) too.
So to be clear: the sad state of affairs going on in the pop world is not the 
fault of people just enjoying the music that's widely available. 

It's the people deciding what gets sold on the marketplace. We're in a world where
studios can announce their yearly lineup of movies and every single one will be 
a sequel, remake, or cash-in of an existing story/franchise. And, we're in a world
where music sales are shrinking to a fraction of what they were. But instead of
trying to shake things up by offering novel experiences, opening up new opportunities
with new modes of interacting with creative works, or supporting inventive artists
that change the game, the market makers who greenlight creative projects have
shrunk into their shells and played a diminishing game of less risk-taking, trying
to cling on to old paradigms that have been rendered obsolete. Not realizing the
chicken and egg issue -- which is that if they were to promote something novel and
interesting to audiences they aren't reaching now, it would sell -- they believe
that their lesson in all this is that they must do the opposite, which is to sell
very homogenous pop music to the people they already reach.

This is the thinking of out of touch people with no access to the marketplace that
will replace the paradigms that have been lost. 

In summary: 

- I reject the stupid pop music that people shrug off as being our only musical option
in the mainstream now. I also feel that rock has stagnated due to less risk
taking by non-creative market-makers, and because of puritan attitudes of old guard
rock musicians who fetishize an outdated aesthetic and music-making process.
Hence, my music and my process.

- I reject that the old marketplace was the ideal situation for musicians and we
should pine for it and rebuild it. I also feel there are novel approaches to sharing
your music with the world that haven't been explored, and there could be a greater gain
to be had in the cheap-to-join, interactive musical world that we live in now.
Hence, the open source music project.
