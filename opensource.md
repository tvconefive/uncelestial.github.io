## The Open Source Music Approach

The idea of Open Source Music is to just open up the whole process of making and releasing music,
having a website, and playing shows, so that it is something that everyone can participate in. 
We believe that being connected to people on the internet is beautiful and a fine replacement for
the price-gouging, payola-driven, consumerist way that music was released in the past. 

By justloosening the grip a little on certain "intellectual rights," and by actively creating avenues
for participation, we hope that we end up being a really fun band to be into.

## In practice

Okay, so what does that mean, and how is it actually different?

Well, you are allowed to do all of the following:

- Remix or samples our songs all you want, release the results, and even charge people for your work,
  without ever paying us anything.
- Feel free to use the multitrack information that we take care to include with every release, or
  download the literal multitrack masters (in Steinberg Cubase format), which should make
  sampling and remixing much easier
- Let us know about what you made, and [we'll sell it on our site for you, forwarding you the money](#submit-stuff).
  Or just sell it on your site and don't worry about getting it on our site, and keep all the money.
- Edit our site to include your ideas, contributions, merch, recordings, pictures, remixes, whatever.
  It's on GitHub at https://github.com/uncelestial/uncelestial.github.io/
- Record our shows and sell the recordings on our site
- As you would with an open-source programming project, check out how it was made by listening to the
  multitracks, or watching the video we took of the recording process for each song.
